# Harmonic Balance

Author: George Ralph

Design: This platformer makes every level a music puzzle. Players solve the puzzle by fixing the out of tune notes.

How To Play:

Each level has a short tune being played on the note blocks, but a few of them are out of tune. Press R to hear the song, and see which blocks are out of tune (flash red). Push crates or stand on top of a note block to bring down 
its pitch.

Use A/D to move left or right, and W to jump. Push crates by walking into them.
